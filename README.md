<h3>About BudgetEd</h3>
<p>In a time when public schools across America are losing government funding, school districts often grapple with increasingly complex budget management. They face unique challenges: juggling diverse funding sources, adapting to fluctuating needs, and ensuring every dollar directly supports student success. Traditional budgeting methods are often time-consuming, prone to error, and lack the foresight needed for optimal resource allocation.</p>
<p>BudgetEd tackles this challenge head-on. BudgetEd is an AI agent designed to transform how school districts manage their finances. By processing complex budget documents and contextual input (like public feedback or strategic goals), BudgetEd intelligently parses data, identifies financial inefficiencies, and provides precise, actionable recommendations for budget optimization. </p>
<p>BudgetEd empowers district administrators to make data-driven decisions, streamline operations, and ultimately allocate more resources directly to education, all without requiring any prior AI expertise.</p>
<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<p>BudgetEd is built on a robust foundation to deliver intelligent insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a></li><li><a href="https://gemini.google/overview">Google Gemini</a></li><li><a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a></li><li><a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a> + <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">TailwindCSS</a></li><li>Axios HTTP</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Learned</h3>
<p>This was our first time that both of us worked together in a hackathon. Building BudgetEd as a team was lots of fun and incredibly rewarding. We sharpened our skills in full-stack development (Vue.js and Node.js). We gained more expertise in prompt engineering, teaching Gemini to deliver precise and actionable financial insights. We learned how to use Google Cloud to build scalable infrastructure and efficient deployments.</p>
<h3>The Future of BudgetEd</h3>
<p>Our vision for BudgetEd extends beyond current capabilities. We want to make BudgetEd more useful for school administrators with the following future features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Predictive Budget Forecasting.</b> We can implement advanced analytics to predict future financial trends and proactively identify areas for savings or investment.</li>
<li><b>Automated Compliance & Reporting.</b> We can streamline the generation of regulatory reports and ensure adherence to local, state, and federal budget guidelines.</li>
<li><b>Integration with Existing Systems.</b> BudgetEd can connect with existing School Information Systems (SIS) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms for real-time data sync.</li>
<li><b>Interactive Scenario Planning.</b> We can build interactive models for administrators to create "what-if" scenarios for different funding changes or strategic initiatives.</li>
<li><b>Customizable AI Agents.</b> Throughout the school year, AI Agents can monitor finances to gain more data for when it's time to revise the budget for the next fiscal year. </li>
</ul>
